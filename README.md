View [Report](/nosql_project.pdf) for detailed description of the project.

    python app.py

<br />


In this project, we created an application related to details of authors. Focus of this project was efficient deployment of database on cloud to enable high latency. To achieve this, we deployed the MongoDB database with 3 Shards in replica sets. We have created a python application to view and modify this data. Note that as the cloud server needs to be stopped due to free tier limit, the application may not work if you try to run it.
